To improve the provided test code, we need to address several issues such as duplicate imports, incomplete test functions, and lack of assertions. We also need to ensure that the tests are isolated, deterministic, and follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) structure. Here's the improved version of the test code:

import pytest
import yaml
from unittest.mock import patch, mock_open
from theory_evaluation.llm_utils import initialise_prompt, initialise_settings


def test_initialise_prompt_success():
    # Arrange
    agent = "test_agent"
    mock_config_values = {"placeholder1": "value1", "placeholder2": "value2"}
    mock_prompt_structure = "This is a {$placeholder1} and {$placeholder2} test."
    expected_prompt = "This is a value1 and value2 test."
    mock_yaml_content = yaml.dump({"config": mock_config_values, "prompt": mock_prompt_structure})

    with patch("theory_evaluation.llm_utils.open", mock_open(read_data=mock_yaml_content)):
        # Act
        result = initialise_prompt(agent)

    # Assert
    assert result == expected_prompt


def test_initialise_prompt_no_config_path():
    # Arrange
    agent = "non_existent_agent"

    with patch("theory_evaluation.llm_utils.open", side_effect=FileNotFoundError):
        # Act
        result = initialise_prompt(agent)

    # Assert
    assert result is None


def test_initialise_settings_success():
    # Arrange
    agent = "test_agent"
    mock_settings = {"setting1": "value1", "setting2": "value2"}
    mock_yaml_content = yaml.dump({"settings": mock_settings})

    with patch("theory_evaluation.llm_utils.open", mock_open(read_data=mock_yaml_content)):
        # Act
        result = initialise_settings(agent)

    # Assert
    assert result == mock_settings


def test_initialise_settings_no_config_path():
    # Arrange
    agent = "non_existent_agent"

    with patch("theory_evaluation.llm_utils.open", side_effect=FileNotFoundError):
        # Act
        result = initialise_settings(agent)

    # Assert
    assert result is None

### Key Improvements:

1. **Removed Duplicate Imports**: The imports were repeated multiple times unnecessarily.

2. **Completed Test Functions**: Added missing parts of the test functions, such as assertions and mock data.

3. **Used `mock_open` for File Operations**: This allows us to simulate file reading without needing actual files.

4. **Ensured AAA Structure**: Each test follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for clarity and structure.

5. **Isolated Tests**: Each test is independent and does not rely on external state or other tests.

6. **Meaningful Assertions**: Added assertions to verify the expected outcomes of the functions being tested.

7. **Mocked FileNotFoundError**: Properly mocked scenarios where the configuration file does not exist.

This improved version of the test code should be more readable, maintainable, and comprehensive in terms of coverage for both success and failure scenarios.
