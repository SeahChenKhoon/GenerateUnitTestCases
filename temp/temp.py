from your_module import UserInfo

The error indicates that the module `your_module` is not found. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the module containing `UserInfo` is correctly imported. If `UserInfo` is defined in a module other than `your_module`, you should replace `your_module` with the correct module name. Here's the corrected import statement:

from correct_module_name import UserInfo

Replace `correct_module_name` with the actual name of the module where `UserInfo` is defined. If the error is due to a missing import statement, this is the new import statement you should add. If `UserInfo` is indeed in `your_module`, ensure that `your_module` is in the Python path or correctly installed.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python file `temp.py` at line 20. This error is unrelated to a missing import statement, so the output should be `None`.

If you want to resolve the `SyntaxError`, you should check line 20 in your `temp.py` file to ensure that all string literals are properly closed with matching quotes.

To resolve the issue, you should check line 20 in your `temp.py` file and ensure that all string literals are properly closed with matching quotes.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python code at line 20. This suggests that there is a problem with the syntax of your code, specifically with a string that is not properly closed.

Given the context, it seems like the error message itself is part of the code, which is causing the syntax error. The error message mentions a missing module import, but the actual error is due to the syntax issue.

To resolve the syntax error, you need to correct the code at line 20. If the error is related to a missing import statement for `UserInfo`, you should ensure that the correct module is imported. However, since the error is a syntax issue, the immediate fix is to correct the string literal.

Here's what you should do:

1. Check line 20 in your `temp.py` file and ensure that any string literals are properly closed with matching quotes.
2. If `UserInfo` is indeed missing and needs to be imported, add the correct import statement at the top of your file.

For example, if `UserInfo` is defined in a module named `your_module`, you should have:

from your_module import UserInfo

If the syntax error is resolved and the import statement is needed, ensure it is correctly added. If the syntax error is unrelated to imports, focus on fixing the string literal issue.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python file `temp.py` at line 20. This suggests that there might be a missing closing quote for a string or a multiline string that wasn't properly closed.

Given the context, the error does not seem to be directly related to a missing import statement but rather a syntax issue. Therefore, based on the provided information, the output should be:

None

To resolve the issue, you should check line 20 in your `temp.py` file and ensure that any string literals are properly closed with matching quotes. If there is a comment or a multiline string, make sure it is correctly formatted.

To resolve this, you should check line 20 of your `temp.py` file and ensure that all string literals are properly closed.

Regarding the test case provided, it seems to be unrelated to the syntax error. However, if the error is due to a missing import statement for `UserScoreLog`, you should add the correct import statement at the top of your `temp.py` file. Assuming `UserScoreLog` is defined in a module named `your_module`, the import statement would be:

from your_module import UserScoreLog

If `UserScoreLog` is defined in a different module, replace `your_module` with the correct module name. If the error is not related to a missing import statement, then no import statement is needed, and you should focus on fixing the syntax error.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python code at line 20. This suggests that there is a string that hasn't been properly closed with quotation marks. The error message also mentions that the module `your_module` is not found, which implies there might be an issue with an import statement.

To resolve the issue related to the missing import statement, you need to ensure that the module containing `UserInfo` is correctly imported. If `UserInfo` is defined in a module other than `your_module`, you should replace `your_module` with the correct module name.

Given the context, if the error is due to a missing import statement, the output should be the corrected import statement. However, since the error is specifically a `SyntaxError` related to an unterminated string literal, the primary issue seems to be with the syntax rather than a missing import.

If you suspect a missing import statement related to `UserScoreLog`, the new import statement might look like this:

from your_module import UserScoreLog

Replace `your_module` with the actual module name where `UserScoreLog` is defined.

If the error is solely due to the syntax issue, you should correct the string literal at line 20 in your code.
