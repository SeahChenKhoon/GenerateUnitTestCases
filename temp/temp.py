from sqlalchemy import inspect

The error message indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` because the module `your_module` cannot be found. This suggests that there might be a missing or incorrect import statement in your test file. However, based on the information provided, it seems like the error is not directly related to the test case `test_projects_table_columns()`.

If the error is due to a missing import statement for `your_module`, you would need to ensure that the module is available and correctly imported. Since the request is to output only the new import statement if the error is due to a missing import statement, and the error is indeed due to a missing module, you should add the correct import statement for `UserInfo` from the appropriate module.

However, without knowing the actual module name where `UserInfo` is defined, I can't provide the exact import statement. If `UserInfo` is defined in a module named `your_actual_module`, the import statement would look like this:

from your_actual_module import UserInfo

Replace `your_actual_module` with the actual name of the module where `UserInfo` is defined. If the error is not due to a missing import statement, then the output should be `None`.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python file `temp.py` at line 26. This error is not related to a missing import statement but rather to a syntax issue in your code. Specifically, it seems like there is a string that is not properly closed with a quotation mark.

To resolve this, you should check line 26 of your `temp.py` file and ensure that all string literals are properly enclosed with matching quotation marks. Once you fix the syntax error, you can rerun your tests.

Since the error is not due to a missing import statement, the output for the import statement is `None`.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in the file `temp.py` at line 26. This error is unrelated to a missing import statement, so the output should be `None`.

However, if you suspect there might be a missing import statement related to the `test_projects_table_columns` function, you should ensure that all necessary modules and classes are imported at the beginning of your script. For example, if `inspect` and `Projects` are not imported, you might need to add:

from sqlalchemy import inspect
from your_module import Projects  # Replace `your_module` with the actual module name where `Projects` is defined

Since the error is specifically about a syntax issue, you should focus on correcting the string literal at line 26 in `temp.py`.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python file `temp.py` at line 26. This error is unrelated to missing import statements, so the output should be `None` as per your instructions.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python file `temp.py` at line 26. This error occurs when a string is not properly closed with matching quotes. To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that all string literals are properly closed.

Regarding the test case provided, it seems unrelated to the syntax error. However, if you suspect that the error might be due to a missing import statement, you should first fix the syntax error and then check if any necessary imports are missing.

Here's how you can address the issues:

1. **Fix the Syntax Error**: Check line 26 in your `temp.py` file and ensure that any string literals are properly closed with matching quotes. For example, if you have a string starting with a double quote (`"`), make sure it ends with a double quote as well.

2. **Check for Missing Imports**: If the error persists after fixing the syntax error, review your code to ensure all necessary modules and classes are imported. Based on the test case provided, you might need to import `inspect` and `SprintIssues` if they are not already imported at the beginning of your script.

   Example import statements:
   from sqlalchemy import inspect
   from your_actual_module import SprintIssues  # Replace `your_actual_module` with the actual module name

If the error is solely due to the syntax issue, fixing the string literal should resolve it. If you need further assistance, please provide more context or the relevant parts of your code.

The error message indicates a `SyntaxError` due to an unterminated string literal in your Python code at line 26. This suggests that there is a string that hasn't been properly closed with a matching quote.

To resolve this issue, you should check line 26 of your `temp.py` file and ensure that all string literals are properly enclosed with matching quotes. Here's a general approach to fix the error:

1. Open the `temp.py` file.
2. Navigate to line 26.
3. Look for any string literals that might be missing a closing quote and correct them.

Regarding the test case `test_sprint_issues_table_columns`, if the error is due to a missing import statement for `SprintIssues`, you should add the appropriate import statement at the beginning of your `temp.py` file. However, since the error is related to a syntax issue, not an import issue, you should focus on fixing the syntax error first.

If you still suspect an import issue after fixing the syntax error, ensure that `SprintIssues` is correctly imported. For example, if `SprintIssues` is defined in a module named `your_module`, the import statement would look like this:

from your_module import SprintIssues
